# Orbit Prgramming using ChatGPT
This project demonstrates animated rotating circles on an HTML5 canvas. The user can interact with the canvas and control various properties of the circles using an interactive UI.

## Prompt
```
1. Create an animated canvas where circles rotate along an orbit.
2. Add interactivity: allow the user to click to add a circle or move existing circles.
3. Provide a control panel to adjust properties like center coordinates, orbit size, and circle size.
4. Implement a grid background and display the mouse cursor position.
5. Allow pausing and resuming the animation with the spacebar.
6. Write a README.md file to document the project, its features, and how it works.
```
